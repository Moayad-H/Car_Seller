# Car_Seller
This project was part of the Web Programming Course.
It is a simple car selling website made using html,css,bootstrap 5,and JavaScript.

In the home page, all availabe cars are displayed from a local database.
A user can search for a car by manufacturer name(BMW, Mercedes...etc) or model name (C63, M5...etc), or  by car type (SUV,Sedan...etc).

In the index page, clickable cards are displayed with the information of each car within them. 
once clicked the user is redirected to a page where more information about the selected car is shown along with large 
pictures of it using a Carousel.

Within the page of each car is a button that redirects the user to a page that prompts them to fill out a contact details form if they are intereste
in contacting the seller of the selected car.

In each page is a Navbar and a footer with their own buttons that take you to different pages.

This is still a work in progress, and there are many features i would like to add as well as change some of the page's design.
